\section{Introduction}

First we'll discuss the Zebra Finch vocalization system and it's mathematical
formulation, and then the control of that system. All code used to generate
figures and results in this paper can be found at:

\subsection{The Zebra Finch Vocalization System}

Like human speech, Zebra Finch song is generated at it's source by oscillations in airflow
generated by vibrating vocal cords. A model for these oscillations is given as:

\begin{align*}
\dot{x}&=\begin{aligned}v\end{aligned} \\
\dot{v}&=\begin{aligned}\gamma^2 \alpha + \gamma^2 \beta x - \gamma^2 x^3 - \gamma x^2 v + \gamma^2 x^2 - \gamma x v\end{aligned}
\end{align*}

The control parameters of the model are $\alpha$ and $\beta$. $\gamma$ = 23500 is a constant.

\subsection{Control of the Syrinx Model}

The goal is to control the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in order to produce an observed
vocalization. Let $\bm{\phi}(t) = \left[ \alpha(t) ~ \beta(t) \right]^T$ be the state vector.

Assume that the temporal evolution of $\bm{\phi}(t)$ is defined by a controlled linear dynamical
system:

\begin{align*}
\dot{\bm{\phi}}=A\bm{\phi} + B\bm{u}
\end{align*}

where $A$ is a 2x2 matrix, chosen to make the passive dynamics of the control system decay
to some physiologically relevant rest state. $B$ is a 2x2 control matrix, chosen to be the
identity matrix for simplicity. Note that the time-scale for simulation the oscillator is
much finer than that of the control. Let $\Delta\tau$ be the time step for simulation of
the control system, and define $t_k = k\Delta\tau$.

In optimal control theory, a cost function is specified and is to be minimized over time to
produce an optimal control law. But what form should the cost function take? We'll make
the following assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The control wants to keep the system's instantaneous energy low: $\bm{\phi}(t_k)^T \bm{\phi}(t_k)$ .
\item The control wants to keep it's instantaneous energy low: $\bm{u}^T \bm{u}$ 
\item The control varies smoothly, i.e. $\left( \bm{\phi}(t_k) - \bm{\phi}(t_{k-1}) \right)^2$ is small.
\item The control wants to produce an instantaneous fundamental frequency that matches that of a stored template.

\end{enumerate}

To elaborate on the last assumption, say we are given the time-varying fundamental frequency of a song syllable that we would
like to learn, represented as the function $F_f(t)$. Let $\hat{F}_f = g(\bm{\phi})$ be the function that gives the steady
state fundamental frequency for a given control $\bm{\phi}$. The function $g$ can be empirically estimated through simulation
and approximated through interpolation. To follow this frequency means to keep the quantity $\left( F_f - g(\bm{\phi}) \right) ^2$
small.

Given these assumptions, we can construct the following instantaneous cost function:

\begin{align*}
C \left( \bm{\phi}(t_{k-1}), F_f(t_k), \bm{u} \right) = c_{\bm{\phi}} \bm{\phi}(t_k)^T Q \bm{\phi}(t_k) +
							c_{\bm{u}} \bm{u}^T \bm{u} +
							c_s \left( \bm{\phi}(t_k) - \bm{\phi}(t_{k-1}) \right)^2 +
							c_F \left( F_f - g(\bm{\phi}) \right) ^2
\end{align*}

where $Q$ is a diagonal 2x2 scaling matrix and the $c_* \in \mathbbm{R}$ are weights to keep the magnitudes of each cost within
a reasonable range. $\bm{\phi}(t_k)$ is given as a forward Euler step:

\begin{align*}
\bm{\phi}(t_k) = \left( A\bm{x} + B\bm{u} \right) \Delta\tau + \bm{\phi}(t_{k-1})
\end{align*}


\subsection{Temporal Hierarchy of Representation}

Generically, we want to determine a joint probability between $\bm{\phi}$ and a set of
variables that are related to the acoustic representation. These features may span several
time scales. For example, instead of just relating $F_f(t)$ and $\bm{\phi}$, i.e. looking
at the joint distribution $p \left( F_f(t), \bm{\phi} \right)$, we might want to look
at the running variance of $F_f(t)$ for a specified time window.

Let $\{ \sigma_1, ..., \sigma_m \}$ be a set of statistics for some acoustic variables. Construct
this set so that they are ordered by time scale. By this, we mean that computing $\sigma_i$
requires a larger window of time than computing $\sigma_j$ if $i < j$.

Finding the optimal control requires maximizing a conditional probability:

\begin{align*}
\argmin_{\bm{u}} C_f = \argmax_{\bm{\phi}(\bm{u})} p \left( \bm{\phi}(\bm{u}) | \sigma_1, ..., \sigma_m \right)
\end{align*}

There may be a "telescoping" algorithm to maximizing $p \left( \bm{\phi}(\bm{u}) | \sigma_1, ..., \sigma_m \right)$
quickly. Start with $\sigma_1$, which is the statistic with the longest time scale.
There should be many instantaneous values of $\bm{u}(t)$ that give a nonzero
probability of occurance with $\sigma_1$. But not all the values will, so restrict the
search for all $\bm{u}$ to that space. Do the same for $\sigma_2$, which will
reduce the size of the space even further. Continue this process until the space of
actual $\bm{u}$ is small enough to do a more efficient optimization, and then
peform that optimization to find the optimal control.
